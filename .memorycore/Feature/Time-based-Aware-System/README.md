#  Time-based Aware System
*Optional extension for time-sensitive collaboration behavior*

## What It Adds
- Time-aware greeting and tone calibration
- Session timestamp discipline for continuity
- Energy/mode adaptation for planning vs execution windows

## Repository-Relevant Usage
Use this feature to adapt collaboration style while working on:
- Morning deep implementation blocks
- Afternoon review/debug cycles
- Evening summary/refinement sessions
- Late-night concise support mode

## Example Behavior
- Morning: implementation-forward energy, short planning overhead
- Afternoon: balanced execution + validation checks
- Evening: cleanup, summaries, follow-up prep
- Night: low-noise support and minimal cognitive load

## Activation
1. Load `time-aware-core.md`
2. Keep command contract unchanged (`Rover`, `save`, `update memory`, `review growth`)
3. Continue grounding all decisions in repository truth

## Compatibility
- Works cleanly with Feature-Dev workflow (`load feature-dev`) to adjust planning/execution pacing by time window.

## Notes
This extension changes collaboration rhythm, not project facts.
